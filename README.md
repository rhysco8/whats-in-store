# What's In Store - WIP

Stock taking app for retail showrooms. What's In Store allows users to create a list of in-store items or check off items against an existing stocktake.

This project was inspired by my time working at a furniture retailer, doing stocktakes using a spreadsheet of all the products expected to be for the showroom. I would print the list, walk round the showroom ticking things off as I went and adding in items which weren't on the list. Then I'd enter the tally for each item into the spreadsheet before sending that off.

This app is designed to help with some of that process by rendering a table of products that you can then tally off.

## Features

#### Importing an existing stock list

* Import excel file (or csv?)
* Display SKU, description, quantity expected
